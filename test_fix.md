# Testing the Repetition Fix

## What was the problem?
The voice browser was repeating responses, saying something like:
- "The current president of the United States is Donald J. Trump as of 2025."
- Then again: "The current president of the United States is Dona..." (cut off)

## What we fixed:

### 1. Backend Changes (voice_browser_server.py)
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging to track message sending
- ✅ Removed duplicate speech calls - now only sends ONE `result` message per task
- ✅ Status messages are separate and don't trigger speech
- ✅ Added proper message flow logging with emojis

### 2. Frontend Changes (page.tsx)
- ✅ Added message deduplication with time-based windows
- ✅ Improved voice selection logic to prevent "No voice selected" errors
- ✅ Added proper speech cancellation and retry logic
- ✅ Better error handling for speech synthesis failures
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging to track speech events

### 3. Key Improvements:
- **Message Deduplication**: Prevents processing the same message multiple times within a 2-second window
- **Voice Selection Fix**: Ensures a voice is always properly selected, preventing synthesis errors
- **Speech Queue Management**: Properly cancels previous speech before starting new speech
- **Error Recovery**: Automatically retries speech with simpler settings if synthesis fails

## How to test:
1. Open the voice browser at http://localhost:3001/voice-browser
2. Click "Start Listening" 
3. Say a command like "Who is the president of the US?"
4. Check the browser console logs - you should see:
   - Only ONE `result` message received
   - Proper voice selection (not "No voice selected")
   - Clean speech synthesis without errors
5. The response should be spoken ONCE, not repeated

## Expected Console Output:
```
📨 Received WebSocket message: result Object
📋 Processing result message: The current President of the United States is...
🎤 Speak function called: Object
🗣️ Using voice: Samantha (or another selected voice)
🚀 Starting speech synthesis
▶️ Speech started: The current President of the U...
⏹️ Speech ended
```

## What to look for:
- ❌ NO "🔄 Duplicate message detected" logs
- ❌ NO "🗣️ No voice selected, using default" logs  
- ❌ NO "❌ Speech error" logs
- ✅ Clean, single speech synthesis
- ✅ Proper voice selection
- ✅ No repetition of the same content
